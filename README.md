# Selenium Exercise

![alt text](./images/selenium_logo.png)

These are the exercise files from Linked Learning course by Meaghan Lewis about automating test case scenarios (like filling a form) in web applications using Selenium WebDriver. There is a large ecosystem of Open Source projects that have sprouted up around Selenium. Hence, Selenium can be extended in different ways through drivers, bindings, plugins, and frameworks created and maintained by third parties. There are also libraries made for each programming language that exposes commands from the Selenium API natively in the form of methods/functions. And in this project, all these functionalities are used to automate keypresses/clicks on a simple site called Formy that has form components that can be used for testing purposes.
